#  WellMe – Team Mobile App Project

Hey there  
Welcome to our **WellMe** app — a simple and fun wellness tracker made by our team!  
We designed and prototyped this mobile app together as part of our course project.

##  Our Team Work

We worked as a small team to create this app idea from scratch:  
- First, we **brainstormed ideas** for a useful app.  
- Then, we **chose the theme “Wellness Tracker”** because it helps people live a balanced life.  
- Together we **designed the wireframe and prototype** using *Figma* and paper sketches.  
- We used **React + Tailwind CSS** to make a realistic app mockup.  
- Everyone helped with **UI design, colors, and testing the flow**.  

During our teamwork, we shared tasks:
- One member worked on navigation and structure.
- Another focused on styling and components.
- Others helped write the report and test the app.

We also learned to **communicate and solve problems together** — and that teamwork makes everything easier.

##  Reflection

This project taught us not only coding,
